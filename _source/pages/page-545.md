NVM Express® Base Specification, Revision 2.1

523
A controller indicates support for the Host Managed Live Migration capability by setting the Host Managed
Live Migration Support (HMLMS) bit to ‘1’ in the Optional Admin Command Support (OACS) field in the
Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 312).
An MMC is not permitted to be migrated and:
• shall support:
• the Migration Send command with the Management Operations,
o Suspend (i.e., 0h);
o Resume (i.e., 1h); and
o Set Controller State (i.e., 2h);
• the Migration Receive command with the Management Operations,
o Controller State (i.e., 1h);
and
• the CNS value of 21h in the Identify command (i.e., Supported Controller State Formats data
structure (refer to section 5.1.13.2.21)).
If the NVM subsystem contains one or more Migration Management Controllers, then:
• each controller (i.e., MMC and Migratable Controller) in that NVM subsystem does not support the
Host Memory Buffer (refer to the Host Memory Buffer Preferred Size (HMPRE) field in the Identify
Controller data structure in Figure 312); and
• each Migratable Controller in that NVM subsystem is allowed to be migrated and shall not support:
o the Migration Send command (refer to section 5.1.17);
o the Migration Receive command (refer to section 5.1.16);
o the CNS value of 21h in the Identify command (i.e., returning Supported Controller State
Formats data structure (refer to section 5.1.13.2.21)); and
o the Controller Data Queue command with the Create Queue management operation
specifying the User Data Migration Queue (refer to section 5.1.4.1.1).
A Controller Level Reset on an MMC shall cause that MMC to:
• delete all User Data Migration Queues on that MMC; and
• stop tracking all host memory changes on that MMC;
A Controller Level Reset on a Migratable Controller shall cause that Migratable Controller to:
• remove a suspended state if that Migratable Controller is suspended by a Migration Send command
specifying the Suspend management operation (refer to section 5.1.17.1.1); and
• retain any persistent controller state that has been committed to that Migratable Controller from a
Migration Send command specifying the Set Controller State management operation (refer to
section 5.1.17.1.3).
During the migration of a Migratable Controller in the Source NVM Subsystem while that Migratable
Controller is processing commands, it may be necessary for the MMHS  to obtain the user data
modifications to namespaces attached to that Migratable Controller and modifications made by that
Migratable Controller to host memory in the host. The Track Send command (refer to section 5.1.27) and
the Track Receive command (refer to section 5.1.26) allows the host to use privileged actions (refer to
section 3.10) to:
• determine user data in namespaces attached to a controller that has changed;  and
• determine host memory that has changed due to commands processed by a controller.
A controller indicates support for tracking changes to user data in namespaces attached to a controller by
setting the Track User Data Changes Support (TUDCS) bit to ‘1’ in the Tracking Attributes (TRATTR) field
in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 312).
